# data-structure-practice
By building a graph, we create a map that contains the name of each city and the distance between each city. Input the maximum distribution distance, and then find the scheme that sets the least city as the distribution center.
instruction:
Download the entire document and run logistics.c. 
Enter the number of cities (nodes) in the map, respectively.
Enter the name of the city separately.
Enter the number of roads (edges) that can be passed between cities. 
Enter the name of the city and an example for each edge.
Enter the maximum delivery distance.
This will output the solution and paths.
